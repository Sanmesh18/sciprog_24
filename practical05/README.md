# Overview
* This is the fifth practical in which we code three programs that we will execute.
	* First program is to understand the scanf function.
	* Second program is for Fibonacci series.
	* Third program is the Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent function.
## To compile:
1. Scanf:
```bash
gcc -o scan using_scanf.c
```

2. Fibonacci Series:
```bash
gcc -o fibonacci fibo.c -lm
```

3. Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent Function:
```bash
gcc -o arctanh arctanh.c -lm
```

## To execute:
1. Scanf: 
```bash
./scan
```

2. Fibonacci Series:
```bash
./fibonacci
```

3. Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent Function:
```bash
./arctanh
```

## Output:
```bash
./arctan
